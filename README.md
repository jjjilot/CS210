# CS210
From Syllabus:

The objective of this course is to introduce the basic concepts and practices of computer science.  We will cover fundamental approaches to computational problem solving (software development) and introduce other computer science topics. These are the foundation for further study of computer science, whether in the CS major or for developing and applying computational methods in other disciplines. We will explore computational concepts  using the Python programming language.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
  - understand, develop, and implement algorithms for computational problem solving;
  - design, develop, and test  computer programs in a disciplined, systematic manner; 
  - demonstrate robust mental models of data representation and code execution;
  - demonstrate good understanding of a high level programming language;
  - implement a sampling of classic computer science problem domains and algorithms

Taught by Prof. Michal Young at University of Oregon.
